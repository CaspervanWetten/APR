Source for testing research.

The goal of each prototypes is to test functionality of using Language model enabled systems for amplifying the reporting process. All prototypes will remain a similar upload->choose a file system. Using the modal to provide the different funcitonalities inside the modal.

Current version is prototype 2. Prototypes 3 and 4 will be developed by adding html pages with their own functionality. The link, using bootstrap, to proto 3 and proto 4 will be an icon in the lefthand bar. A colour change transition, 3-> Yellow 4 -> green

# Prototype 3 description:

Proto 3 will form a microsofot word-like interface. The left and right columns are accentuated and divided into blocks. Each source-block is named a form of information extracted from the source uploaded text. E.g. identified names, reactions to shown items or videos, recounted questions.
The source-block, visually more of a flat blob, will be populated by actual, draggable blocks of text, taken literally from the source uploaded file. These passages have to be quoten verbatim.
The whole system will allow the user to effectively provide a report of the conversation in a question-answer style.


# Prototype 4 description:

proto 4 is not unlike protos 2 and 3, it has a similar base page but with a green color. The modal for proto 4 shows, like proto 3, a word-like interface with a pre-existing editable preamble. Instead of the column with meta-blocks and blocks. proto4 implements LLM support by enabling "thoughts" as the user is typing. Visualizing these as comic-thoughtbubbles floating on the page. These thoughts should be collected at runtime similar to the blocks in proto3, and should be contextually relevant to what the user is typing. These should be selectable via tab and enterable via tab+enter.
